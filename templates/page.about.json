In 2017, Papel couldn’t stop thinking about the company that could have been, but never was. So, he started tinkering around with new designs, manufactured Passport Security® Pocket Socks and started selling online again. Based on excitement from new customers and Papel’s entrepreneurial passion, he decided to re-invested in his original idea. This time, he threw a whole lot of color into the mix. The colorful fun and fashionable personal expression line was born to compliment the already successful travel security & everyday convenience.<\/p>",
